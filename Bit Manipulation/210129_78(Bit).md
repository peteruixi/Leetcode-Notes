### Code

``` python
def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(nums)
        ans = []
        for s in range(1 << n):
          # for n = 3, iterate from 0 to 7
            tmp = []
            for i in range(n):
              # iterate from 0 to 2
                if s & 1 << i >0:
                  # e.g. if 001 AND 001 or 010 or 100 is True, add to temp
                    tmp.append(nums[i])
                    print(tmp)
            print('appended tmp,'tmp)
            ans.append(tmp)

        return ans
```

stdout for learning how the code works

```
appended tmp []
[1]
appended tmp [1]
[2]
appended tmp [2]
[1]
[1, 2]
appended tmp [1, 2]
[3]
appended tmp [3]
[1]
[1, 3]
appended tmp [1, 3]
[2]
[2, 3]
appended tmp [2, 3]
[1]
[1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]
appended tmp [1, 2, 3]
```



### Approach

This solution for `78. Subsets` utilized bit manipulation technic. When receiving the number string in `nums` assume the taken and not taken in combination is represented by 1 and 0. Say we have a `nums` as [0,1,2] we could construct the following "truth table". With 3 digits, there will be $2^n$ possible combination making 8 subsets, from $ (000) _{2} $ to $ (111) _{2} $

| Subset | Binary  |
| ------ | ------- |
| 000    | []      |
| 101    | [0,2]   |
| 010    | [1]     |
| 111    | [1,2,3] |
| ...    | ...     |

To check a value is selected using the formula `s & (1<<i)`

the `&` operate make sure that if there 1 and index i, if runs the if statement.

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: $O(N*2^N)$
- Space Complexity: $O(N)$ could optimize to $ O(1)$

### Code

``` python
def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
  bitmask = 0
  for num in nums:
    bitmask ^= num
    print(bitmask)

    # # rightmost 1-bit diff between x and y
    print (bitmask, -bitmask)
    diff = bitmask & (-bitmask)

    x = 0
    for num in nums:
      # bitmask which will contain only x
      if num & diff:
        x ^= num
	
  return [x, bitmask^x]
```



### Approach

#### 1. 

In the solution for this problem, we are utilizing the property of XOR. The property of XOR gives that if two value are the same and they XOR together it returns 0. 

> 0 ⊕ a = a
>
> a ⊕ a = 0

The thought process is that we create a bitmask and set it to 0 and XOR through the entire array. Since all values in the array except for 2 are paired, if we have the array `[1,2,1,3,2,5]`. We would have

$ 1⊕1⊕2⊕2⊕3⊕5 $

$= 0⊕0⊕3⊕5 $

$= 3⊕5  \rightarrow (011)_{2} ⊕ (101)_{2} = (110)_{2}$

#### 2.

From the bitmask output, how do we derive the value of 5 and 6. From the bitmask value and the XOR property, the bitmask value tells that at least one bit in between 3 and 5 are not the same given a value in the bitmask value has a 1 in it. 

Using `diff = bitmask & (-bitmask) ` since (-bitmask) is taking the 2's complement $(110)_{2}$ becomes $ (010)_{2} $. We will get where the right most `1 bit` is at.

diff = $ (010)_{2} $ & $ (110)_{2} $  = $(010)_{2}$ 

**between 3 and 5, only 3 has the bit set on the 2nd bit.**

And amount all values of the group we could seperate it by:

**Numbers with the 2nd bit set to 1:**

 $ 2 = (010) _{2} $

 $ 2= (010)_{2} $

 $ 3= (011)_{2} $

**Numbers with the 2nd bit set to 0:**

 $1 = (001) _{2} $

 $ 1 = (001) _{2} $

 $ 5 = (101) _{2} $

#### 3.

With the diff value we iterate through the list, we `AND` the value with our diff value, if the output returns 0 that means it belongs to the **Numbers with the 2nd bit set to 1** subgroup. Then we extract the number with `XOR` it with 0, since the two 2's cancels each other out in this process, the output will be 3. 

And we then `XOR` bitmask and 3, that will gives 5.
