### Approach

Iterate through the array first time to check where the matching characters are in the string and set the value to 0. Then set the distance value for all the number following the 0. In the second iteration, we are setting the distance value for all the number before 0 was discovered, since in the first time, without knowing the position of 0, those value were remained untouched

### Code 

``` python
def shortestToChar(self, S: str, C: str) -> List[int]:
        S = list(S)
        n = len(S)
        #ret = [n]*n #float('inf')
        pos = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n):
            if(S[i]==C):
                S[i]=pos =0 
            else:
                S[i] = pos
            pos +=1
        
        pos = float('inf')
        for j in range(n-1,-1,-1):
            if(S[j]==0):
                pos =j
            S[j] = min(S[j],abs(pos-j))     
        return S
```

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: $O(2N) \approx O(N)$

- Space Complexity: $O(N)$

  > Originally I thought the space complexity would be O(1) with using the list(str) operation, then I thought, in memory, the storage size changed from a size of variable in data type string to a list where every entry is a stand alone str, so it would be O(N)
