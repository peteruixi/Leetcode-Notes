### Approach

First we need to figure out the total number of steps to the top. Say len(nums) is n and indexing of each value will be n-1, the question essentially turns to what is the minimum cost of getting to index n (say the nums array has one extra place)

Here I optimized the given leetcode offical solution to space complexity of $O(1)$ by operating on the nums array. 

### Code

``` python
def minCostClimbingStairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(2,n-1):
            nums[i] = nums[i]+min(nums[i-1],nums[i-2])
        print(nums)
        # When we reach to value at index n
        return min(nums[-1]+nums[-3],nums[-2])
```

### Complexity

- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Time Complexity: O(n) , n = len(nums)
