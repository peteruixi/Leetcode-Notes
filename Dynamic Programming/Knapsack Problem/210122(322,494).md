### Code

``` python
def coinChange( coins, amount) -> int:
    if not coins: return -1 # coins = []
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1) #'inf' = infinity 
    dp[0] = 0
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1, 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
        print('iteration for coin:',coin,': ',dp)
    if dp[amount] == float('inf'):
        return -1
    else:
        return dp[amount]
```

Essentially, use dynamic programming to construct relations depicted in the table above. Where the row cooresponds to the amount of value targeted and the column shows the coin that is present in the `coins ` array. 

Here in the code I constructed the following 1-D array of the length amount+1. And had the initial value of the array to be 0 meaning, when the desired amount of 0 there is no combination of coins to construct the value of 0.

Using the example:

 ```txt
 Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
 Output: 3
 Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
 ```

| Amount         | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | ...  | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   |
| -------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| min # of coins | 0    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 2    | ...  | 3    | 3    | 2    | 3    |

The print out during each stage of the iteration for each value of coins shows a better picture of the program in action: 

```
iteration for coin: 1 :  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
iteration for coin: 2 :  [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6]
iteration for coin: 5 :  [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3]
3
```

The line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)` is what makes up the **dp**. It finds the minimum between the current minimum solution of obtaining amount **i** and using former solution for obtaining **i** by `amount - coin` value.

***E.g.*** **At amount = 11, coin = 5 :**  min(6 and `dp[6]+1 =`**3**)

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(# of coins * amount)
- Space Complexity: O(amount)

## 494. Target Sum

### Code

```Python
def findTargetSumWays(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        total = sum(nums)
        if total < target: return 0 
        dp=[[0 for _ in range(total*2+1)] for _ in range(len(nums)+1)]
        dp[0][total] = 1
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(nums[i],2*total+1-nums[i]):
                #print(dp[i][j])
                if dp[i][j]:
                    dp[i+1][j+nums[i]] += dp[i][j]
                    dp[i+1][j-nums[i]] += dp[i][j]
                    
        return dp[-1][total+target]
```



### Approach

Consturct a 2-Dimensional DP matrix, where the colums are the all possible output from the nums array. And the rows represents the number of num in the nums array is contributing the output value. 

> [1,1,1,1,1] :arrow_right: [-5,+5]
>
> [1,2,3,4,5] :arrow_right: [-15,+15]

Also need to consider the base case of output of 0, which there is one way to do it by taking an empty set. Hence, the width of the dp matrix is `2*sum(nums)+1)`. 

Using the example of: 

``` 
Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
Output: 5
Explanation: 

-1+1+1+1+1 = 3
+1-1+1+1+1 = 3
+1+1-1+1+1 = 3
+1+1+1-1+1 = 3
+1+1+1+1-1 = 3

There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
```

The matrix will be as follow:

One thing to notice is that each value is the summation of the two neighbouring from previous iterations. (The spacing is dependent on the actual value of the num, so it might not be the direct adjacent. 

And in the last iteration, the sum of the entire row is 32, which is the same as the number of combinations that can be made from the nums array. $2^5 =32 $

To find the total number of getting `S = 3`  would be 5. 

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: $O(sum*2*len(nums))$
- Space Complexity: $O(sum*2*len(nums))$ :arrow_right: $o(n)$
