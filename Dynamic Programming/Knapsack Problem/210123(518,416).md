### Code

Python:

``` Python
def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0]*(amount+1)
        dp[0] = 1
        
        for coin in coins:
            for i in range(coin, amount+1): 
                dp[i] += dp[i-coin]
        return dp[amount]
```
Java:

``` Java
public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
    if (coins == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
    dp[0] = 1;
    for (int coin : coins) {
        for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            dp[i] += dp[i - coin];
        }
    }
    return dp[amount];
}
```

### Approach

Thinking regarding to former made decisions, what is the sub problem: if we are construction the value of dp[amount] we would need the answer from amount-coin. 

Compare to `322. Coin Change`, the version here in 518 adds one extra condition being that the coin in the bag of coins is reusable. And rather than finding the minimum number of coins that makes up an amount, here, the question ask for the total number of ways to make up an amount. There for the relation is going to be different when constructing the DP matrix compare to previous one.

Using the example:

```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
```

Program print out at each value of coin:

```
iteration for coin 1 :  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
iteration for coin 2 :  [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
iteration for coin 5 :  [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
4
```
---

At base case, we know there is one way of getting value 0 which is by using none of the coins, hence dp[0] = 1. And for **coin = 1**, the `np` array populate as followed:

| Amount            | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Ways to construct using [1] | 1    | **1** |   1   |    1  |  1    |   1  |

When **coin = 2**,

We identify the subproblem. Say we need to assemble 3 from coin of value [1,2]. The number of ways to do so would be number of ways to get value `dp[amount - coin]` plus known ways to get current value from previous iteration

| Amount            | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Ways to construct using [1] | 1    |  1    |   1   |    1  |  1    |   1  |
| Ways to construct using [1,2] | 1 | 1 | **2** | 2 | 3 | 3 |

And lastly with the iteration of  **coin = 5**:
| Amount            | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Ways to construct using [1] | 1 |  1    |   1   |    1  |  1    |   1  |
| Ways to construct using [1,2] | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| Ways to construct using [1,2,5] | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | **4** |

> Since a coin cannot divide and make up for a value that is smaller than itself, the value in bold represent the value where the inner loop started.

The question asked for the number of ways to complete value 5, the answer to that question is: **4**

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: O (# of coins * amount)
- Space Complexity: O (amount+1)

## 416. Partition Equal Subset Sum

<img src="/Users/apple-5/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20210123203358031.png" alt="image-20210123203358031" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Code 

``` Python
def canPartition(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        total = sum(nums)
        if total % 2 == 1:
            return False
        else:
            target = total//2
            dp = [False] * (target+1)
            dp[0] = True
            for i in range(len(nums)):
                for j in range(target, nums[i] - 1, -1):
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - nums[i]]
            return dp[-1]
```

### Approach

Construct a DP array where the column stands for each individual value of the total sum of the nums array divided by two. This is taking advantage of the property of the array being equally divided base on the sum of sub arrays.

Using the example:

```
Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
```

Total sum of the array is 22, and the sum of each sub array will be 11. The dp array will be as followed

The **initial condition** is set to True, since the value of 0 can be achieve with an empty array and the rest were set to false.

| Amount                | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   |
| --------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Can be achieved with? | T    | F    | F    | F    | F    | F    | F    | F    | F    | F    | F    | F    |

Iterate for each value of the value in nums:

```
Iteration for  1 : [True, True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]
Iteration for  5 : [True, True, False, False, False, True, True, False, False, False, False, False]
Iteration for  11 : [True, True, False, False, False, True, True, False, False, False, False, True]
Iteration for  5 : [True, True, False, False, False, True, True, False, False, False, True, True]
True
```

Its worth pointing it out that for the inner loop is iterating inversely, this is because the setup of the dp being 1-Dimensional, the value later are dependent on value earlier in the row from previous iterations, so in a 2D array expression we will have something like: 

| Amount     | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6     | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11           |
| ---------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------------ |
| []         | T    | F    | F    | F    | F    | F    | F     | F    | F    | F    | F    | F            |
| [1]        | T    | T    | F    | F    | F    | F    | F     | F    | F    | F    | F    | F            |
| [1,5]      | T    | T    | F    | F    | F    | T    | T     | F    | F    | F    | F    | F            |
| [1,5,11]   | T    | T    | F    | F    | F    | T    | **T** | F    | F    | F    | F    | **T**        |
| [1,5,11,5] | T    | T    | F    | F    | F    | T    | T     | F    | F    | F    | T    | **<u>T</u>** |

The result of which is noted by `dp[-1]` is the output from `dp[6]` and `dp[11]` from the previous iteration. If the inner loop was done regularaly, that value in `dp[6]` might get overwritten, forcing a wrong result.

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: O (# of nums * amount)
- Space Complexity: O (amount+1)
