### Code

```python
def largestNumber(self, cost: List[int], target: int) -> str:
        dp = [0]+[float('-inf')]*target
        for i in range(9,0,-1): 
        # i = value , cost[i] = cost, target works is target of cost
            for j in range(1,target+1):
                if cost[i-1] <= j :
                    dp[j] = max(dp[j], (dp[j-cost[i - 1]] * 10) + i)
        return str(dp[target]) if dp[target] > 0 else '0'
```

### Approach

Given an array `cost `and a target. It's `index+1` will be use to construct a string of numbers, and the `cost` array tells the corresponding cost of assembling such string. 

In the example, cost = [4,3,2,5,6,7,2,5,5], target = 9, numbers could be used repeatedly. Hence it's a complete Knapsack problem. 

When constructing the `dp` array, I looked into constructing something like this:

| amount | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| String | 0    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |

For each value in `cost` which is iterating from high to low. This is using the basic math property where large value in higher order of the number is greater in value. 

The inner loop iterates the target value from 1 to the target. 

In side the loop we check if the cost of the value which is obtain by `cost[i-1]` is smaller than the current amount. Which is basically checking if we are able to afford use the number. 

To populate the dp, we compare the current stored value with `dp[j-cost[i-1]]*10+i`. 

Say we have dp[2] = 9 and dp[3] = 3, and we currently at dp[3]. With the cost we have an option to get value 7, we are comparing the value of `3` and `97`. 97seems to be the obvious choice for a bigger number

### Complexity

- Space Complexity: O(target+1)
- Time Complexity: O(9*target), 9 since the question said that the length of nums is limited to 9.
