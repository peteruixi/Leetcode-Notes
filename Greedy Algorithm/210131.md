### Code

``` python
def findContentChildren(self, child: List[int], cookie: List[int]) -> int:
        child = sorted(child)
        cookie = sorted(cookie)
        nchild = len(child)
        count = i = j = 0
        while i <nchild:
            while j<len(cookie) and child[i]>cookie[j]:
                j+=1
            if j<len(cookie):
                count+=1
                j+=1
            i+=1
        return count
```



### Approach

What I gathered from doing Greedy algorithms is that, it essentially is a skinned down version of dynamic programming problems. One of the key traits of DP problem is that we have to considered the decision made previously while in greedy algorithm we are relying on a universal logical relations. DP could find the optimial solution under certain limitation, that limitation could be availability of the item judging by time and cost (my personal uneducated conclusion). 

The question give a list of "appetite" of children in the children array, and a list for the cookies we have. We are trying to find the number of children we could satiate base on the "size" of cookie we have. 

Essentially, we are looping through the "appetite" of these kids and for each kid find if the cookie in the cookies array is big enough. If it is big enough increment cound and move to next cookie else, skip to the next kid in line.

### Complexity

- Time complexity: $ O(mlogm + n logn)$
  - The time complexity for looping through the two array is $O(m+n)$, the $O(nlogn)$ part comes from calling `sorted()` which used binary sort I believe.
- Space Complexity: $ O(logm +  logn)$
  - Over head caused by calling `sorted()`

## [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

> Beware that the testcases contains negative intervals as well

### Code

```Python
def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals = sorted(intervals,key = lambda x:x[1])
        n = len(intervals)
        if n <= 1:
            return 0
        count=0
        start,end= intervals[0][0], intervals[0][1]
        for i in range(1,n):
            print(intervals[i][0],intervals[i][1])
            if intervals[i][0]>=end:
                if intervals[i][0]<start:
                    start = intervals[i][0]
                end = intervals[i][1]
            else:
                count +=1
        return count
```

### Approach

This question is similar to the class arrangement question discussed in the book `Grokking Algorithms` by Aditya Bhargava. From a given array of intervals and each have it's starting a nd ending point, find the ones that are overlapping and count them. 

The problem states that find the **minimum** number overlaps that needs to be taken out, to make the rest non-overlapping. Which is other words, is to make the entire interval as **granular** as possible, so more interval could fit in.  The "greedy part " about this solution is to always pick the one with the smallest ending point to begin with and in each iteration find the one that starts immediately after the previous interval ends. This is the reason why we are sorting te intervals array by it's ending point.  

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: $ O(mlogm)$
- Space Complexity: $ O(logn)$
