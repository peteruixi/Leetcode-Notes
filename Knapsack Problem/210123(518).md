### Code

``` Python
def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0]*(amount+1)
        dp[0] = 1
        
        for coin in coins:
            for i in range(coin, amount+1): 
                dp[i] += dp[i-coin]
        return dp[amount]
```

### Approach

Compare to `322. Coin Change`, the version here in 518 adds one extra condition being that the coin in the bag of coins is reusable. And rather than finding the minimum number of coins that makes up an amount, here, the question ask for the total number of ways to make up an amount. There for the relation is going to be different when constructing the DP matrix compare to previous one.

Using the example:

```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
```

Program print out at each value of coin:

```
iteration for coin 1 :  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
iteration for coin 2 :  [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
iteration for coin 5 :  [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
4
```
---

At base case, we know there is one way of getting value 0 which is by using none of the coins, hence dp[0] = 1. And for **coin = 1**, the `np` array populate as followed:

| Amount            | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Ways to construct using [1] | 1    | **1** |   1   |    1  |  1    |   1  |

When **coin = 2**,

We identify the subproblem. Say we need to assemble 3 from coin of value [1,2]. The number of ways to do so would be number of ways to get value `dp[amount - coin]` plus known ways to get current value from previous iteration

| Amount            | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Ways to construct using [1] | 1    |  1    |   1   |    1  |  1    |   1  |
| Ways to construct using [1,2] | 1 | 1 | **2** | 2 | 3 | 3 |

And lastly with the iteration of  **coin = 5**:
| Amount            | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Ways to construct using [1] | 1 |  1    |   1   |    1  |  1    |   1  |
| Ways to construct using [1,2] | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| Ways to construct using [1,2,5] | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | **4** |

> Since a coin cannot divide and make up for a value that is smaller than itself, the value in bold represent the value where the inner loop started.

The question asked for the number of ways to complete value 5, the answer to that question is: **4**

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: O (# of coins * amount)
- Space Complexity: O (amount+1)
