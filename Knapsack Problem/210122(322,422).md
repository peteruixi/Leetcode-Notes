### Code

``` python
def coinChange( coins, amount) -> int:
    if not coins: return -1 # coins = []
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1) #'inf' = infinity 
    dp[0] = 0
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1, 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
        print('iteration for coin:',coin,': ',dp)
    if dp[amount] == float('inf'):
        return -1
    else:
        return dp[amount]
```

Essentially, use dynamic programming to construct relations depicted in the table above. Where the row cooresponds to the amount of value targeted and the column shows the coin that is present in the `coins ` array. 

Here in the code I constructed the following 1-D array of the length amount+1. And had the initial value of the array to be 0 meaning, when the desired amount of 0 there is no combination of coins to construct the value of 0.

Using the example:

 ```txt
 Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
 Output: 3
 Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
 ```

| Amount         | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | ...  | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   |
| -------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| min # of coins | 0    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 2    | ...  | 3    | 3    | 2    | 3    |

The print out during each stage of the iteration for each value of coins shows a better picture of the program in action: 

```
iteration for coin: 1 :  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
iteration for coin: 2 :  [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6]
iteration for coin: 5 :  [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3]
3
```

The line `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)` is what makes up the **dp**. It finds the minimum between the current minimum solution of obtaining amount **i** and using former solution for obtaining **i** by `amount - coin` value.

***E.g.*** **At amount = 11, coin = 5 :**  min(6 and `dp[6]+1 =`**3**)

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(# of coins * amount)
- Space Complexity: O(amount)
